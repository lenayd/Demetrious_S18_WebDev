            <h1> MICHAEL DEMETRIOUS </h1>
            <h4>
                <p> Michael Demetrious has been in the entertainment industry since childhood. At age seven, he performed on the Ed Sullivan Show and by 15 performed on Broadway in Liz Swados' Runaways. During adolescence, however, Michael ended his acting career to become a musician, and dropped his first album when he was just 18 years old. After his daughter, Lenay, was born, Michael worked for several years as a producer, musical director, and announcer for The Ron and Fez Show, a national comedy radio show hosted by Ron Bennington and Fez Whatley. In most recent years, Michael has been primarily focused on his musicianship, and has been in a number of groups, including (but not limited to) Patti Rothberg, KissNation, and his current project, Interruptus. </p>

            <h4>
                <p> The daughter of Michael Demetrious, Lenay emerged as a radio sensation when she first called into The Ron and Fez Show at only four years old.  Four years later, the young comedienne began hosting her own show, Lenay D's Musical Saturday Mornings, which aired for three and a half years and celebrated 119 episodes. At 14, Lenay enrolled at Talent Unlimited High School, where she majored in Drama and performed in six theatrical productions alongside her classmates. Today, she studies Integrated Digital Media and Film Production at New York University's Tandon School of Engineering and Tisch School of the Arts, respectively. </p>
