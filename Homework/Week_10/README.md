# Week 10 

In this Folder, you'll find my homework for Week 10. 

For this assignment, I decided to do a random image generator that would display a film still from
different Quentin Tarantino films, as well as a caption briefly explaining the still (i.e., the actor 
and film). 

You can read about my process here:
