# Week 2 

In this Folder, you'll find my homework for Week 2. 

For the assignment's first bullet point, I created a sitemap for Budget Bytes (www.budgetbytes.com),
which is a recipe website specifically designed for people on a budget! You'll find my sitemap by
clicking on the attachmemt named "Sitemap.jpeg" in this folder. 

For the assignment's second bullet point, I read the article about wireframing posted on the class
GitHub repository and posted a reaction to the reading on my blog. You can access my blog post at
http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu/~lenaydemetrious/Afs/ 

For the assignment's third bullet point, I created a wireframe for my recipe's page on its
hypothetical recipe website. I tried my best to mark it up with as many semantic HTML tags
as possible for practice when I start creating my own webpages in the future. You'll find my
wireframe by clicking on the attachment named "RecipeWireframe.jpeg" in this folder.

Lastly, for the last bullet point, I marked up my recipe page semantically and tried to
incorporate some basic font and color styles to make it a little more aesthetically pleasing.
You'll find my HTML file by clicking on the attachment named "RecipeHTMLMarkup.html" in this folder.
