#Week 3 

In this Folder, you'll find my homework for Week 3. 

I went ahead and marked up my recipe page with CSS. It definitely was a process-- I'd be lying if I said it all came easy and took me under an hour to do. It ended up taking me hours and hours to do, but that's just because I'm not familiar with HTML and CSS at all and wanted to make sure I fully understood everything as I did it. Overall though, I think I did a pretty good job, and I'm proud of my work! 

Some of the files in this folder are assets I used for the page (i.e., font, images, etc.), but there are two CSS files (a main.css file and another file for a stylesheet I created specifically for this page layout) and one HTML file that comprise the code for the webpage.
