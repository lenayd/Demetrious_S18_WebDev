#Week 1 

In this Folder, you'll find my homework for Week 1. 

I set up and emailed you my GitHub Repo link, then downloaded all the required software needed for the class. 

I also found a neat recipe for some yummy Vietnamese Spring Rolls and saved it in a .txt file here in this folder. 

Finally, I got my blog and server space set up. You can find the link to my blog here:
